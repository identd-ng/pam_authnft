# Security practices

This document is the single overview of the security-tooling and
security-process surface around pam_authnft. It exists so a new
contributor (or a third-party reviewer like OSTIF, Trail of Bits,
NCC, etc.) can see what's in place at a glance, without reading every
workflow YAML and every doc file.

OSTIF best-practices guide §5 ("Document security tools, practices,
and goals") + §7 ("Security milestones") are satisfied by keeping
this document current.

## Security tools in use

Each row below is a real, running, **automated** check. The "Catches"
column lists the bug class or signal each tool produces.

| Tool | Where | Cadence | Catches |
|---|---|---|---|
| **GCC + Clang build matrix** | `.github/workflows/build.yml` | every PR | compiler warnings (`-Wall -Wextra -Werror=implicit-fallthrough`), hardening-flag survival |
| **cppcheck** | `.github/workflows/cppcheck.yml` | every PR | static analysis: dangerous constructs, leaks, simple misuse |
| **CodeQL** | `.github/workflows/codeql.yml` | every PR | static taint analysis, OWASP-style classes |
| **Coverity Scan** | `.github/workflows/coverity.yml` | weekly cron | deeper static analysis (path-sensitive, inter-procedural) |
| **AddressSanitizer + UBSan** | `.github/workflows/sanitizers.yml` | every PR | build-only validation that the .so links cleanly with sanitizers (test-run conflicts with seccomp) |
| **OpenSSF Scorecard** | `.github/workflows/scorecard.yml` | weekly cron + push | supply-chain hygiene (pinned action versions, branch protection, signed releases, dangerous workflows) |
| **OpenSSF Best Practices** | bestpractices.dev project 12496 | manual self-attest | governance / policy items the badge program tracks |
| **CIFuzz** | `.github/workflows/cifuzz.yml` | every PR | 60 s × 8 fuzz harnesses (memory-safety regressions) |
| **Nightly fuzz cron** | `.github/workflows/fuzz-nightly.yml` | daily 03:17 UTC | 30 min × 8 fuzz harnesses (deeper bugs that 60 s won't surface), auto-issue on crash |
| **Mutation testing (mull)** | `.github/workflows/mutation.yml` + `make mutation-report` | weekly Sunday 06:43 UTC | LLVM-IR mutations across `src/*.c` + `tests/test_suite.c`; surviving mutations indicate either coverage gaps or dead code |
| **Differential oracle** | `tests/oracle/`, run via `make test` | every PR | logic bugs in 5 small parsers (C vs Python re-implementation diff) |
| **Property-based tests** | `tests/oracle/properties.py` | every PR | idempotence + round-trip violations on the same 5 parsers |
| **Unit suite** | `tests/test_suite.c`, run via `make test` | every PR | 10 stages: symbol whitelist, sanitization, sandbox kill/survive, cgroup invariant, hardening flags, peer lookup, keyring fetch |
| **Integration suite** | `tests/integration_test.sh` | manual / container | pamtester open+close cycles, leftover-state assertions, per-session isolation, failure-path rollback |
| **valgrind on unit suite** | `make test-integration` | manual | leaks, use-after-free, double-free |
| **Dependabot** | `.github/dependabot.yml` | weekly | GitHub Actions version bumps |
| **fuzz-coverage measurement** | `make fuzz-coverage` → `docs/fuzz-coverage/` | manual / per-PR | per-function fuzz region/line/branch coverage; gates the ≥90% bar in `docs/FUZZ_SURFACE.md` |
| **Reproducibility check** | `make reproducibility-check` | manual / per-release | bit-identical same-machine builds |
| **Trace-based seccomp provenance** | `make trace`, `make trace-features` | manual | confirms the seccomp allowlist matches actually-used syscalls |

## Security goals

These are the things we are trying to be true. Each is tracked by one
or more tools above; if a tool that backs a goal fails, we treat it as
a blocker, not a warning.

1. **Memory safety in every parser of attacker-influenced bytes.**
   Backed by: ASan/UBSan in CI, libFuzzer with property assertions,
   valgrind on unit suite. Per-function ≥ 90% region coverage on every
   fuzzed function.

2. **The seccomp allowlist matches reality.** Backed by `make trace`,
   plus invariant guard #5 in `docs/CONTRIBUTING.txt`.

3. **Logic bugs in the small parsers don't ship silently.** Backed by
   the differential oracle (5 functions, 286 inputs, C vs Python diff)
   and property-based tests (idempotence, round-trips).

4. **Failed open_session leaves no kernel or systemd state behind.**
   Backed by integration test 10.14 and the partial-cleanup helper in
   `nft_handler_setup`.

5. **Fragment trust boundary is enforced.** Backed by `validate_fragment_content`
   plus integration tests 10.4 (uid != 0) and 10.5 (world-writable),
   plus the `audit(7) AUDIT_USER_ERR` emission on every rejection path.

6. **The exported PAM symbol set is exactly two.** Backed by stage 0 of
   the unit suite (`test-symbols`).

7. **Same-machine reproducible builds.** Backed by
   `make reproducibility-check`.

## Security milestones

Recurring schedule. The "every minor release" items run as part of the
release process; a release that skips one is incomplete.

| Cadence | Activity | Owner |
|---|---|---|
| Every PR | All `every PR` tools above | author + reviewer |
| Every minor release (0.X.0) | `make trace` + diff vs `src/sandbox.c` allowlist | maintainer |
| Every minor release | `make reproducibility-check` + record release-notes hash | maintainer |
| Every minor release | `make fuzz-coverage` + verify per-function ≥ 90% holds | maintainer |
| Every minor release | Refresh `docs/THIRD_PARTY.md` if any dep moved | maintainer |
| Daily | `fuzz-nightly` workflow | automated; auto-files issues on crash |
| Weekly | OpenSSF Scorecard run | automated; SARIF surfaces in code-scanning |
| Weekly | Coverity Scan | automated; defect dashboard |
| Weekly | Mutation testing (`mutation.yml`, Sunday 06:43 UTC) | automated; surviving mutations reviewed against `tests/test_suite.c` |
| Weekly | Dependabot scan | automated; PR per outdated action |
| Soft-ongoing | Re-run `make trace` on kernel / glibc upgrades | maintainer (per `docs/TODO.txt`) |

## Audit history

A running record of internal and external audits. External engagements
get a formal write-up; internal audits are summarised in the relevant
`docs/` file or in PR descriptions.

| When | Type | Scope | Outcome |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-04 (this audit) | Internal multi-phase | Phase 1 alloc paths, Phase 2 concurrency claims, Phase 3 trust model, Phase 4 differential + property + mutation testing, Phase 6.1 nightly fuzz, 6.5 audit hook | 4 real bugs found and fixed (3 heap OOBs + 1 off-by-one); harness coverage from 0 to 9 functions ≥ 90%; mutation testing wired in (mull, weekly cron); OSTIF best-practices alignment to mostly green |

When external audits land, append a row.

## What this document is NOT

- A threat model. The threat model lives in
  [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.txt`](ARCHITECTURE.txt) and
  [`SECURITY.md`](../SECURITY.md) "Scope" section.
- An implementation guide. Look at `docs/CONTRIBUTING.txt` for that.
- A bug log. Bugs are tracked in `docs/FUZZ_SURFACE.md` "Bugs found"
  and on the GitHub issue tracker.

## When to update this document

- A new automated check joins (or leaves) CI: update the "Security
  tools in use" table.
- A new security practice doc is written: update the "Security
  practices documents" table.
- An external audit completes: add a row to "Audit history".
- The release process gains or loses a step: update "Security
  milestones".
