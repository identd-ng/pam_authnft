/*
 * Session data persisted via pam_set_data("authnft_cg_id", ...).
 * The key name predates this struct; it is kept for compatibility with the
 * documented lifecycle invariant. `remote_ip[0] == '\0'` marks the cg-only
 * fallback path, where no src_ip was bound.
 *
 * `cg_path` holds the session's cgroupv2 path (without leading slash),
 * e.g. "authnft.slice/authnft-alice-12345.scope". This is the value the
 * kernel resolves to a cgroupv2 inode at nft insert time via the
 * `socket cgroupv2 level 2` expression.
 *
 * `scope_unit` is the systemd transient-scope unit name,
 * "authnft-<user>-<pid>.scope". Used as the filename key for
 * /run/authnft/sessions/<scope_unit>.json and as an audit field.
 *
 * Per-session nftables state: each session gets its own chain
 * (`chain_name`) and three sets (`set_v4`, `set_v6`, `set_cg`).
 * A jump rule in the shared `filter` chain dispatches to the
 * per-session chain; `jump_handle` stores its nftables handle for
 * cleanup. This is the pf-anchor-equivalent isolation model.
 *
 * `correlation_id` is a short opaque token used to join the open and
 * close audit events for the same session across the systemd journal.
 * Captured from PAM env "AUTHNFT_CORRELATION" (sanitized) or synthesized
 * at open_session if the env var is absent.
